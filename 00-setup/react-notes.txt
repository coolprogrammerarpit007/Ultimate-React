Why do frontend framework like react is required?

1. Front-end web applications are all about Handling data + displaying data in the user Interface.
2. UI needs to stay in sync with data.
3. React like front-end frameworks helps keeping a user Interface in sync with data

// What is React ?
Javascript library for building user Interfaces.
// Extermely Popular, Declarative,Component-based state-driven JS library fot building UI.
// Components are building block of React.
// We build complex UI by building components and combining these components to build UI.
// We describe how components look like and how they work using a declarative syntax called JSX.
// Declarative means react what a component should look like,based on current data/state.
// React is abstraction away from DOM.

// State-driven -> whenever data/state changes, react reacts to state-change by re-rendering the UI.

// js is a library.

React applications are entirely made out of components.
Components are the building blocks of user interfaces in React.
Components are piece of UI that has it's own data,logic and appereance(how it works and looks)
we build complex UIs by building multiple components and combining them.
Components can be re-used , nested inside each other and pass data between them.
