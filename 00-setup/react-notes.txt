State:- STATE is the most fundamental concept in react,whenever we want to change something in the UI, we change or update the state.

Why do frontend framework like react is required?

1. Front-end web applications are all about Handling data + displaying data in the user Interface.
2. UI needs to stay in sync with data.
3. React like front-end frameworks helps keeping a user Interface in sync with data

// What is React ?
Javascript library for building user Interfaces.
// Extermely Popular, Declarative,Component-based state-driven JS library fot building UI.
// Components are building block of React.
// We build complex UI by building components and combining these components to build UI.
// We describe how components look like and how they work using a declarative syntax called JSX.
// Declarative means react what a component should look like,based on current data/state.
// React is abstraction away from DOM.

// State-driven -> whenever data/state changes, react reacts to state-change by re-rendering the UI.

// js is a library.

React applications are entirely made out of components.
Components are the building blocks of user interfaces in React.
Components are piece of UI that has it's own data,logic and appereance(how it works and looks)
we build complex UIs by building multiple components and combining them.
Components can be re-used , nested inside each other and pass data between them.

Rules for writing components.
1. When writing component, it should be capital
2. Component must need to be return Markup., it can also return null

JSX
This is a declarative syntax to describe what components look like and how they work.
Each component must return a block of JSX.
JSX is an extention of Javascript that allows us to embed Javascript CSS and Html components into React.
Each JSX element is converted to a React.createElement function call.

JSX is declarative

Imperative

Manual DOM element Selection amd DOM traversing.
Step by step DOM Mutations untill we reach the desired UI.
// Imperative means telling browser what and how to do.

Declarative
Describe what UI should look like using JSX., based on current data.
Raact is abstraction from DOM.
In react, UI is reflection of data called state in future. not need to tell browser how to mutate DOM react handles it very well.

Props
// How to pass data between components. and mainly from parent component to the child component.
1. we use props to pass data from the parent component to the child component.(down the component tree.)
