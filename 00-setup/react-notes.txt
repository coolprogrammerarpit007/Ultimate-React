// What is React ?
Javascript library for building user Interfaces.
// Extermely Popular, Declarative,Component-based state-driven JS library fot building UI.
// Components are building block of React.
// We build complex UI by building components and combining these components to build UI.
// We describe how components look like and how they work using a declarative syntax called JSX.
// Declarative means react what a component should look like,based on current data/state.
// React is abstraction away from DOM.

// State-driven -> whenever data/state changes, react reacts to state-change by re-rendering the UI.

// js is a library.
